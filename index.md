OWASP WAFControl is an open-source project that provides a modern web-based interface for managing ModSecurity and the OWASP Core Rule Set (CRS). Its primary goal is to simplify the deployment, configuration, and tuning of web application firewalls by eliminating the need for complex command-line and file-based operations. The project targets DevSecOps teams, security engineers, and system administrators who need a reliable, visual, and secure platform to manage WAF rules, monitor attacks, edit configurations, and apply updates efficiently. Future releases will introduce AI-assisted recommendations, rule analytics, alerting systems, and support for custom rule sets, making WAFControl a comprehensive and intelligent WAF management solution.

### Road Map
The OWASP WAFControl project is already in an advanced, production-ready state. Core components such as the installation of ModSecurity, OWASP CRS, and Nginx WAF are fully operational. The system currently includes:

-A functional dashboard
-Automated WAF + CRS installer
-Live attack logging with filters and metadata
-Critical attack viewer and top attacking IP analytics
-CRS rule viewer, editor, and enable/disable toggle system
-ModSecurity settings editor
-Custom rule builder with advanced options (tags, transformations, severity, chaining, etc.)
-CRS version switching interface
-Admin profile and secure authentication (2FA-ready)

The project source code is finalized and will be published on GitHub once the OWASP application process is approved. A live demo is also available upon request.

Over the next 12 months, the project roadmap will focus on:
-Publishing the project publicly and onboarding contributors

* Expanding documentation and localization
-Adding intelligent rule suggestions via AI
-Providing curated community rule packs beyond CRS
-Implementing system alerting and live monitoring tools
-Building a plugin system for future extensibility

OWASP WAFControl is ready to serve as a robust open-source GUI for ModSecurity + CRS management, with a strong long-term vision for innovation in WAF usability and security intelligence.
