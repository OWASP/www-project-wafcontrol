**1st Modern, Web-Based GUI Dashboard for ModSecurity & OWASP CRS**

OWASP WAFControl is an open-source project that provides a modern web-based interface for managing ModSecurity and the OWASP Core Rule Set (CRS). Its primary goal is to simplify the deployment, configuration, and tuning of web application firewalls by eliminating the need for complex command-line and file-based operations. The project targets DevSecOps teams, security engineers, and system administrators who need a reliable, visual, and secure platform to manage WAF rules, monitor attacks, edit configurations, and apply updates efficiently. Future releases will introduce AI-assisted recommendations, rule analytics, alerting systems, and support for custom rule sets, making WAFControl a comprehensive and intelligent WAF management solution.
